# TNS Observability Demo

A simple three-tier demo application, fully instrumented with Prometheus, OpenTracing and Go-kit logging.

The "TNS" name comes from "The New Stack", where the original demo code was used for [an article](https://thenewstack.io/how-to-detect-map-and-monitor-docker-containers-with-weave-scope-from-weaveworks/).
